I've here two web systems:
  The first one is a system that allows users to buy and sell products or services online. It includes features such as product search, shopping cart, checkout, payment, and delivery tracking.
  The second one is a system used to control traffic lights, monitor vehicle flow, identify infractions and optimize traffic in urban areas through sensors and cameras connected to a control center.

None of these systems have integrations with the back-end or database. All of this was generated to simulate a scenario from which metrics will be used to analyze the software. All data was mocked.
